PROBLEM
Ultimate Frisbee is a sport in continuous growth that is experiencing its first momemnts of professionism. 
High Level Players approach training and game weeks with rigor and are rewarded with professional coaching staffs.
In 2024, at Europen Ultimate Club Finals, the 2nd most competitive league in the World, a couple of fields out of 16 available record the games played. {TODO: check fields number}
Bologna Flying Disc La Fotta wants to get back the Euorpean gold medal that was hanging on its neck in 2019 and 2022. {TODO: check years when CUSB won EUCF} 
Persuaded by the most Physical Defence in Europe, as well as consciuos the strenghts of the other top seeds, the team had a clear ambition. {TODO: is better "purpose", "goal", "objective", "aim", "intention", "target"?} 
I looked for an edge {TODO: is better "competitive advantage", "leverage", "upper end"} by providing knowledge to the Head Coach. 
Since most of the games cannot be rewatched later for enjoyment, nor to be studied for tactical advantage, I've come up with a solution to review a game as detailed as possible.
Most of the High Level Coaching Staff in Ultimate take player stats of the game: how many points each player is in the lineup for each game, and, that's all. At least is something, it would be cool to gather all of those lineups in a public database.
In my experience as an Ultimate Frisbee Coach I polished my Stats Taking. 
Right now, a person, that doesn't have to instruct the whole team, can take the following stats, the most important, in a single A4 paper: {NOTE: yes, it should be automated by an app}

DATA GATHERING:
TEAM STATS
 - POINT-TO-POINT Stats
   - lineups
   - results
   - offence/defence
   - gender m/w (mixed division only)
   - number of Turnover
 - foreach DISC POSSESSION
   - offence set play
   - defensive strategy
   - active game time 
HYSTORY foreach Player
 - POINT-TO-POINT Stats
   - Positive:
     - Throws/Catches 
       - #Hucks
       - #Flows
       - #Breaks
       - #Skys
       - #Swings
       - #Overtake throws
       - #Something special
       - #Assist
       - #Goals
     - Defence
       - #Blocks
       - #Help defence (involved in the creation of the turnover)
   - Negative:
     - Offence
       - #Throwaways
       - #Bad/Unforced throwaways
       - #Drops
     - Defence
       - #Open side catches
       - #Breaks throws
       - #Deep catches




HOW TO IMPROVE:
1) Better way of saving data: (ei. in points_player most of the player, everybody exept for 7, don't play and don't have any stats on each point. We can reduce the memory usage by a factor of m where m is the number of players.)
